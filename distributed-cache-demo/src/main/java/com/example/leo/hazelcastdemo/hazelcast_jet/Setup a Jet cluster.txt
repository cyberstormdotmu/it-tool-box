	bin/jet-start   [-d](daemon process)

In another terminal
	bin/jet cluster (to see cluster state)
	
The distribution package also contains a pre-packaged Jet job in a JAR that you can use to quickly verify the installation. You can submit it like this:
	bin/jet submit examples/hello-world.jar

*** If we run another bin/jet-start we'll have another node in the cluster :)
